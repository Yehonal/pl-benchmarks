# EULER BENCHMARK

### === INTRO ===

This is the [Problem #12](https://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=12) from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) to compare (surely not optimal) implementations in:
 
- C
- C++
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript
- Php
- Perl

In order to get some higher execution times, it searchs for the first triangle number with more than 1000 divisors instead of 500 as stated in the original problem.

You can find some results here: [https://github.com/Yehonal/pl-benchmarks/wiki]

### === REQUIREMENTS ===

To fully compile and run all benchmarks you need following packages installed:

- time
- gcc
- g++
- pypy
- python2 or python3
- cython2 or cython3
- php
- perl
- nodejs
- jre ( for javac and java )
- bash ( of course )

### === USAGE ===

First of all, you must rename config.sh.dist in config.sh ( and modify its contents with your needs )

After that you just need to execute "run-benchmark.sh" file in your bash shell

The entire process can take several minutes to terminate. So be patience.
